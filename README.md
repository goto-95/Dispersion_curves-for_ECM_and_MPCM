# Dispersion curves for Expansion Chamber Mufflers (ECM) and for Microperforated Chamber Muffler (MPCM)
MATLAB codes for computing the dispersion curves for the conventional expansion chamber and the micro-perforated chamber. The code computes the eigenroots related to the radial and axial wavenumbers for the chamber domain.

The main file is "DispersionCurve.m" which extract the data of both silencer from the "DataSilencer.m" file. The rest of the codes are auxliar function to identify and compute the eigenroots of the characteristic equations.

Plese, feel free to suggest any modification and improvement. Enjoy!
